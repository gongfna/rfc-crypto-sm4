= Compute Structure

The SM4 algorithm is a blockcipher, with block size of 128 bits and a key
length of 128 bits.

Both encryption and key expansion use 32 rounds of a nonlinear key schedule
per block. Each round processes one of the four 32-bit words that constitute
the block.

The structure of encryption and decryption are identical, except that the round key
schedule has its order reversed during decryption.

Using a 8-bit S-box, it only uses exclusive-or, cyclic bit shifts and S-box
lookups to execute.
