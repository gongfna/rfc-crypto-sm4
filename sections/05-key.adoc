= Key And Key Parameters

The SM4 encryption key is 128 bits long and represented below, where each
$$MK_i, (i = 0, 1, 2, 3)$$ is 32 bits long.

$$
MK = (MK_0, MK_1, MK_2, MK_3)
$$

The round key schedule is derived from the encryption key, represented as below
where each $$rk_i (i = 0, ..., 31)$$ is 32 bits long:

$$
(rk_0, rk_1, ... , rk_31)
$$


The family key used for key expansion is represented as $$FK$$, where
each $$FK_i (i = 0, ..., 3)$$ is 32 bits long:

$$
FK = (FK_0, FK_1, FK_2, FK_3)
$$


The constant key used for key expansion is represented as $$CK$$, where
each $$CK_i (i = 0, ..., 31)$$ is 32 bits long:

$$
CK = (CK_0, CK_1, ... , CK_31)
$$
